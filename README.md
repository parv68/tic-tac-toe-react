# Tic Tac Toe React
## In this project, I have create a Tic Tac Toe game using React.js.
## You can play the game by clicking on the cells of the grid. The first player is X and the second player is O. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
## If all of the cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
